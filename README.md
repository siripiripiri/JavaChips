## Overview

An Apple A Day is an intuitive web application designed to help individuals assess the seriousness of their medical symptoms using artificial intelligence. By providing preliminary health assessments, our solution helps users determine whether they need to consult a doctor, thereby reducing unnecessary visits for minor issues and avoiding delays in treating serious conditions.

People often struggle to gauge the severity of their medical problems, leading to uncertainty about whether to seek medical attention. This can result in unnecessary doctor visits for minor issues or delays in addressing major health concerns.

To address this problem, we developed a web application that utilizes AI to analyze symptoms and offer preliminary health assessments. Users input their symptoms into the application, which is trained on extensive healthcare research data, to receive a basic health check. This assessment includes:

- Possible causes of the symptoms
- Suggested courses of action
- Recommendations on whether immediate medical attention is needed
