# An Apple A Day

## Overview

An Apple A Day is an intuitive web application designed to help individuals assess the seriousness of their medical symptoms using artificial intelligence. By providing preliminary health assessments, our solution helps users determine whether they need to consult a doctor, thereby reducing unnecessary visits for minor issues and avoiding delays in treating serious conditions.

People often struggle to gauge the severity of their medical problems, leading to uncertainty about whether to seek medical attention. This can result in unnecessary doctor visits for minor issues or delays in addressing major health concerns.

To address this problem, we developed a web application that utilizes AI to analyze symptoms and offer preliminary health assessments. Users input their symptoms into the application, which is trained on extensive healthcare research data, to receive a basic health check. This assessment includes:

- Possible causes of the symptoms
- Suggested courses of action
- Recommendations on whether immediate medical attention is needed

## Key Features

- **Symptom Input**: Users can enter their symptoms to receive an AI-generated health assessment.
- **Health Assessment**: The application provides information on possible causes, suggested actions, and urgency for medical attention.
- **User Profile**: New users create a profile by logging in and filling out a form with details like gender, weight, medical conditions, allergies, and medical history.
- **Symptom History**: Users can view their previous searches and health assessments.
- **Find Health Centers**: The application helps users locate nearby hospitals and health centers.

## Technologies Used

- **React 18**: For building the user interface.
- **Firebase**: For authentication and database storage.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and sleek UI design.
- **Gemma LLM**: For advanced natural language processing and AI-driven health assessments.
